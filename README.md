# brazil-weather-data

For this project I have to understand the factors influencing investments within Brazil's energy sector.

I have been provided a dataset detailing the hourly surface weather from over 600 weather stations across Brazil.

I will need to  approach these objectives in the following order:
- Provide a report of the last two decades of weather change across Brazil. (In progress)
- Identify a list of areas that would be suitable for harnessing wind power, include reasoning. 
- Identify a list of areas that would be suitable for harnessing solar power, include reasoning.
- Identify a list of areas that would require an investment in irrigation, include reasoning
- Provide a tool to forecast the amount of rainfall in the future for an area that would be of interest to the local population.
